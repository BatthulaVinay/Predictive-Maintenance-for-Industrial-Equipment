# Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Equipment

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to focus on **Predictive Maintenance** for industrial equipment. The goal is to predict potential machine failures before they occur, enabling proactive maintenance and reducing downtime.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains sensor data from industrial machines, including features such as:
- **Air Temperature** (K)
- **Process Temperature** (K)
- **Rotational Speed** (rpm)
- **Torque** (Nm)
- **Tool Wear** (min)
- **Machine Failure Indicators** (TWF, HDF, PWF, OSF, RNF)

## 🎯 Objective
The goal is to build a **machine-learning model** that predicts whether a machine will fail based on sensor readings. This helps industries reduce **downtime**, optimize **maintenance costs**, and improve **operational efficiency**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Modeling:** Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

## 📌 Key Steps
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Data visualization & insights
   - Handling missing values & outliers

2. **Feature Engineering**
