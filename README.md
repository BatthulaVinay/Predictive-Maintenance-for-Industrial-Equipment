# Predictive-Maintenance-for-Industrial-Equipment

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Predictive Maintenance** for industrial equipment using machine learning. The goal is to predict potential machine failures before they occur, enabling proactive maintenance and reducing downtime.

## 🚀 Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand failure patterns
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and outliers
- Feature engineering for improved model performance
- Machine learning models for failure prediction
- Model evaluation and visualization of results

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains multiple sensor readings and machine operating conditions. Key features include:
- **Air temperature [K]**
- **Process temperature [K]**
- **Rotational speed [rpm]**
- **Torque [Nm]**
- **Tool wear [min]**
- **Machine failure (Target Variable)**
